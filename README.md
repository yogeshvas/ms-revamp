This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Contact Form Email Setup

The contact form sends emails to `writetokhair@gmail.com`. To enable this functionality, you need to set up environment variables:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Add the following environment variables:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   ```

**Note:** For Gmail, you'll need to use an App Password instead of your regular password. To generate an App Password:
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Go to Google Account settings > Security > App passwords
3. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
4. Use this app password as your `EMAIL_PASS` value
